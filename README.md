# CelestialBodies
A 3d simulation engine for celestial bodies in C++ using OpenGL. Includes: collisions, universal gravitation, and directional gravity. Can be used to model particle and planetary systems.  

Will clean up later. 
Running the .exe demos requires freeglut.dll and glut32.dll (both included).
